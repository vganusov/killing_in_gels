# killing_in_gels

This repository has the data from Budhu et al. JEM 2010 paper (PMID: 20065066) on survival of B16 tumor cells when co-inoculated into collagen-fibrin gels together with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Data are from 5 different datasets. See the paper by Majumder et al. (biorxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.28.534600) for details.

We also include a Mathematica 12 code to fit alternative models to Datasets 1-4 (or 1-5) from these data.
