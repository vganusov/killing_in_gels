# killing_in_gels

This repository has the data from Budhu et al. JEM 2010 paper (PMID: 20065066) on survival of B16 tumor cells when co-inoculated into collagen-fibrin gels together with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Data are from 5 different datasets. See the paper by Majumder et al. (biorxiv: ) for details.

We also include a Mathematica 12 code to fit 5 alternative models to Datasets 1-4 from these data.
